# Dasanama Perangane Awak
Interactive body map, to show body parts name in javanese language including _dasanama_ (alias) for the given part.
This tool is heavily based on [bodyMap](https://github.com/abdchehadeh/bodyMap) combined with [tooltipster](https://codepen.io/Moneypenny/pen/wFBrk/) to show the body parts name.

## Getting Started 

As mentioned in [bodyMap](https://github.com/abdchehadeh/bodyMap), I'm using [image-map](https://www.image-map.net/) to create area map.


### Running
